#DESCRIPTION OF DECISIONS

	We believe a program like this has a valuable place in the academia, and will be well received by both professors and students.  We are currently researching existing foundations for automated grading programs, in order to expand and improve on these models.  (TEAM: here we need to prioritize our user stories and explain why we chose that priority)     The main goal of this project is to create an automated grading system, so this will be our number one user story to focus on.  The two attributes that should be included in the product are automation and quickness.  Having the grades returned relatively quickly is  a high priority.  Making sure that the route from start to finish happens in a timely fashion.  Documentation of the grading is a high priority.  The students want credit for completing the work and the professor needs it for grading.  The professor side of the grade book is more important than the student feedback.  The student can go to the Professor if there are questions or concerns.  Having an easy way to submit the files is low priority.  Eventually there will be a generic way to submit that will suit everyone.
We used google docs to collaborate ideas and modify information.  There was also a slack group setup to make communication easier.  Eventually a github will be included to share code.
